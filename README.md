# Libft Project

## Introduction

The `Libft` project is the first challenge in the Ã‰cole 42's core curriculum. It focus on the development of a highly useful library with 43 functions. This project is an important step in understanding, implementing, and utilizing core functions since it instills those fundamental skills. 


In addition, this library stands out as a cornerstone for future projects. It serves as a solid foundation, allowing the effective use of its current features as well as the integration of new functionalities.


This project offers a practical opportunity to engage in string manipulation, memory allocation, character operations, output handling, file descriptors, number conversions, and other essential utilities. It serves as a crucial step in cultivating practical coding proficiency and gaining a profound understanding of fundamental programming concepts.

## Project Structure

**Mandatory**: This essential set of functions spans a diverse range, encompassing character operations, string manipulation, and memory allocations. It includes functions such as `ft_isascii.c`, `ft_memcpy.c`, `ft_putstr_fd.c`, `ft_strlcat.c`, `ft_strrchr.c`, and more.

**Bonus**: In addition, the bonus section introduces functions tailored for linked list operations. These include `ft_lstadd_back_bonus.c`, `ft_lstclear_bonus.c`, `ft_lstiter_bonus.c`, `ft_lstmap_bonus.c`, `ft_lstsize_bonus.c`, `ft_lstadd_front_bonus.c`, `ft_lstdelone_bonus.c`, `ft_lstlast_bonus.c`, and `ft_lstnew_bonus.c`.

## Library Functions

The `libft` library includes functions in the following categories:

- **String Manipulation**: Functions for manipulating strings.
- **Memory Allocation**: Functions for memory management.
- **Character Operations**: Functions for handling individual characters.
- **Linked Lists**: Functions for working with linked lists.
- **Additional Functions**: Other utility functions.

## Building and Compiling

To build the library, run the following commands:

```bash
make
